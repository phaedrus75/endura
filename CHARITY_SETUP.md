# Setting Up a Conservation Charity in the UK

## Endura Conservation Foundation
*A youth-led charity dedicated to protecting endangered species*

**Founder & Youth Director**: Rhea (Age 16)

---

## Executive Summary

This guide outlines how to establish a registered charity in England & Wales focused on wildlife conservation, with a young person (under 18) in a leadership role. While UK charity law has age restrictions for trustees, there are clear pathways for young founders to lead meaningfully.

---

## Key Legal Considerations for Young Founders

### Age Restrictions in UK Charity Law

| Role | Minimum Age | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Charity Trustee** | 16 years | As of Charities Act 2022 (previously 18) |
| **Company Director** | 16 years | For CIOs and charitable companies |
| **Signing Legal Documents** | 18 years | Contracts, bank accounts, etc. |

### ✅ Good News for Rhea!
As of the **Charities Act 2022**, the minimum age to be a charity trustee in England & Wales was **lowered from 18 to 16**. This means Rhea can legally serve as a trustee!

However, there are practical considerations:
- Some banks require account signatories to be 18+
- Some grant-makers prefer trustees over 18
- An adult co-trustee is recommended for legal/financial matters

---

## Recommended Structure

### Option 1: Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

A CIO is the simplest structure for a new charity:
- ✅ Legal entity (can own assets, enter contracts)
- ✅ Limited liability for trustees
- ✅ Only registers with Charity Commission (not Companies House)
- ✅ Lower admin burden than charitable company

### Proposed Governance Structure

### Rhea's Role: Youth Director & Founder

While an adult may need to be the formal "Chair" for banking/legal purposes, Rhea can:
- ✅ Be a full voting trustee
- ✅ Lead the charity's vision and strategy
- ✅ Be the public face of the organization
- ✅ Direct programs and partnerships
- ✅ Have the title "Founder & Youth Director"
