# Social Features – Ideas for Endura

## 1. Study Buddy System

- Two friends commit to a study schedule (e.g. 30 min/day for 7 days)
- Both put up a small eco-credit wager
- If both complete it, both get their credits back + a bonus
- If one fails, the other gets the full pot
- Visual progress tracker showing both users side by side

Also you can have a special pact to study together in real time.
- Pair up with a friend to co-study in real time (both timers run simultaneously)
- See a live indicator that your buddy is currently studying
- Both earn a bonus 10% eco-credits when completing a session together
- If one person quits early, the other gets a notification: *"Your buddy's egg is in danger!"*

## 2. Study Groups
- Create a named group (e.g. "Bio Exam Crew") with up to 10 friends
- Shared group goal: collective study minutes toward a target (e.g. 500 min this week)
- Group unlocks a special rare animal or decoration when the goal is met
- Group chat (lightweight, text-only)


## 3. Friends
- **Weekly Study Leaderboard** – ranked by total study minutes among friends
- **Streak Showdown** – compare streaks with friends; longest active streak gets a crown badge on their profile

- Friend Activity Feed
- A simple feed on the home screen or a dedicated tab showing:
  - "[Friend] just hatched a Polar Bear!"
  - "[Friend] completed a 90-minute study session"
  - "[Friend] is on a 7-day streak"
- Tap to send a quick reaction or encouragement ("Nice!" / "Keep going!")


## 4. Sanctuary Visits
- Visit a friend's animal sanctuary and see their animals + decorations
- Leave a reaction (e.g. a small emoji sticker) on their sanctuary that they can see next time they open it
- "Featured Sanctuary of the Week" – voted on by friends

## 5. Animal Gifting
- Gift a duplicate animal from your collection to a friend
- The animal arrives in the friend's sanctuary with a note: *"A gift from [username]!"*
- Limited to duplicates only (x2+), so you always keep at least one



## 6. Trade Market
- Post a decoration or accessory for trade
- Friends can propose a swap (their item for yours)
- Both parties confirm → items exchange sanctuaries



## 7. Collaborative Egg Hatching
- A special "Legendary Egg" that requires 2-3 friends to each contribute study sessions
- Each friend's progress fills a shared progress bar
- When complete, everyone gets the same rare animal
- Creates a shared sense of achievement and motivation

## 8. Profile Showcase
- Public profile card showing: top 3 animals, streak, total study hours, sanctuary snapshot
- Share to social media or copy a link
- "Compare with friend" view – side-by-side stats
